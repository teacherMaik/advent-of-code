## Overview

With the Google Sheets challenges, I could get surprisingly far ome years! Each Year has it's own file with different individual sheets for each day. Most puzzles are solved through seperating steps into different columns.

When using Google Apps Script, the data is parsed from the sheets. Some sheets have Custom menus to run the scripts from the UI.

Some solutions rely on **Google Sheets** to store and manage input data for Apps Script. Links to the sheets are provided below.
